# Quick Start Guide for OPFEM

This Quick Start guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running OPFEM, an open-source Python-based finite element modeling software. Follow these steps to get started:

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Python**: Ensure you have Python 3.10 installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Conda (Optional)**: Consider installing Conda to create virtual environments and manage dependencies. You can download Miniconda or Anaconda from the [official website](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

The details of the installation and the basic knowledge of Conda is introduced in [Install Anaconda and Python](./install_anaconda_and_python.md).
